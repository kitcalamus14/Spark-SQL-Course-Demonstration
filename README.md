### Spark SQL & Python Demonstration on Databrick Cloud Platform
This is part of the assignments I completed using Databrick. I'm sharing this to showcase my coding using SQL on Cloud based platform.
In addition, python was used periodically when needed within the same notebook, as supported by Databrick using the %python magic command.
I changed the name of the courses to prevent online answer leak.
